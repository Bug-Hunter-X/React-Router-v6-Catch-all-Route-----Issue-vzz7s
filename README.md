This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route ('*') in React Router v6. The issue arises when trying to render a 404 Not Found component for any invalid route. The provided solution demonstrates how to resolve this by ensuring that the catch-all route is placed last within the Routes component, guaranteeing that it only catches routes not matched by other routes.
